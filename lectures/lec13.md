# Packages

We group related types (classes, interfaces enums and annotation types) into **packages**

- Makes things easier to find and use
- helps avoid naming conflicts
- helps control access

## Creating a package

put package statement at top of source file we want to be in package: i.e ```package cars;```

## Naming conventions

Usually reversied internet domain name
- Anything in java.* and javax.* are considered Java standard library
- ca.ualberta or a dev at ualberta.ca

If no package is specified, it is put into an unamed package. Will work but not recommended

# Midterm cutoff!
