# Refactoring

- change var names to more readable, meaningful name

Methods of refoactoring:
- Composing M

## Composing methods

- we prefer short methods over long methods
- easier to test, debug and understand

### Extracting method
- if you have to spend substantial effort understanding what a block of code does, then it should probably be its own method

### Inline method
- reverse of extract method

### Extract variable
- make more variables to get more information about the code at a certain break point
- turn one large expression in to many
- replace hardcoded values with variables

### Rename method
- make method names self-descriptive

### Remove dead code
- lowers readability
- confused over why it's there
