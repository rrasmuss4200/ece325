Practice session for OOP

Building a game:

## 3 Classes:

- Game Launcher:
  - launches the game
  - contains main method

- Game Class:
  - p1, p2, p3
  - startGame method
  - create players
  - randomly select a number 0-9
  - until someone guesses correctly, ask for guesses
  - Math.random() generates nums 0.0 - 1.0

- Player:
  - a guess
  - a name
